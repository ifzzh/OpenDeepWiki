        ## Document Creation Guidelines
        1. Content Organization
           - Begin with a clear executive summary (200-300 words) establishing purpose, audience, and key objectives
           - Organize information in a logical progression from core architecture to implementation details
           - Include comprehensive yet concise explanations with appropriate technical depth
           - Ensure each section connects logically to the next with smooth transitions between topics
           - Aim for a total document length of 5,000-10,000 words, with no section exceeding 1,500 words

        2. Code Structure Analysis
           - MANDATORY: Read and analyze files from the catalogue provided - ALL content must be derived from these files
           - Prioritize analysis based on file importance:
             * [HIGH] Entry points, core components, and configuration files
             * [MEDIUM] Supporting modules and utilities
             * [LOW] Test files and external libraries
           - Read each identified file's content using the provided file functions
           - Create focused visual diagrams that highlight key relationships rather than attempting to document everything
           - Limit code examples to 30 lines maximum with clear annotations
           </document_creation_framework>

        <visual_documentation>
        ## Visual Documentation Guidelines

        - Focus on practical implementation details rather than theoretical analysis
        - Highlight key optimizations and potential bottlenecks
        - Note any edge cases or special handling
        - Consider scale and performance characteristics

        ### Dependency Analysis

        For dependencies:

        - Map direct dependencies between major components
        - Identify external libraries and their purposes
        - Note interface boundaries between components
        - Highlight coupling points that could present challenges
        - Focus on architectural dependencies over implementation details </analysis_framework>

        <fallback_strategies>

        ## Fallback Strategies

        If you encounter challenges during document creation:

        1. Repository Size Constraints
           - For repositories with >20 files:
             - Focus on entry points and core components only
             - Document directory structure instead of individual files
             - Create higher-level architecture diagrams
             - Sample representative files from each component type
        2. File Complexity Issues
           - For files >1000 lines:
             - Focus on public API and interfaces
             - Document top-level structures only
             - Use abstraction in diagrams rather than exhaustive mapping
             - Select representative sections for deeper analysis
        3. Missing Information
           - If README is missing or uninformative:
             - Infer purpose from file and directory names
             - Focus more on structure than domain-specific details
             - Document what is observable without making assumptions
             - Note the limitation explicitly
        4. Technical Limitations
           - If unable to create complex diagrams:
             - Use simpler representations
             - Break complex diagrams into smaller focused ones
             - Rely more on textual descriptions
             - Use tables as an alternative to relational diagrams

        Always explicitly note when a fallback strategy has been applied and why.

             </analysis_structure>

             PHASE 2: CATALOGUE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
             - Analyze the project file structure to identify key components, entry points, and organization patterns
             - Map relationships between directories and files
             - Identify primary modules, services, and components
             - Determine project type (frontend, backend, full-stack, data-intensive, monorepo)

             Input source:
             <catalogue>
             {{$catalogue}}
             </catalogue>

             <section_adaptation>
             Dynamically adjust analysis based on detected project characteristics:
             - For **frontend projects**: Include UI component hierarchy, state management, and routing analysis with Mermaid component diagrams:
               ```mermaid
               graph TD
                 App[App Component] --> Header[Header]
                 App --> Router[Router]
                 Router --> Page1[Page Component 1]
                 Router --> Page2[Page Component 2]
                 Page1 --> SharedComponent[Shared Component]
                 Page2 --> SharedComponent
               ```

             - For **backend services**: Analyze API structure, data flow, and service boundaries with Mermaid sequence diagrams:
               ```mermaid
               sequenceDiagram
                 Client->>+API Gateway: Request
                 API Gateway->>+Service A: Forward request
                 Service A->>+Database: Query data
                 Database-->>-Service A: Return data
                 Service A-->>-API Gateway: Response
                 API Gateway-->>-Client: Final response
               ```

             - For **data-intensive applications**: Examine data models, transformations, and storage patterns with Mermaid entity-relationship diagrams:
               ```mermaid
               erDiagram
                 USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
                 ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
                 PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "ordered in"
               ```

             - For **monorepos**: Map cross-project dependencies and shared utility usage with Mermaid flowcharts:
               ```mermaid
               graph TD
                 SharedLib[Shared Libraries] --> ProjectA
                 SharedLib --> ProjectB
                 SharedLib --> ProjectC
                 ProjectA --> CommonUtil[Common Utilities]
                 ProjectB --> CommonUtil
               ```
             </section_adaptation>

             PHASE 3: DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS
             - For each key file identified in PHASE 2, perform deep analysis:
               1. Read and analyze the content of main entry points
               2. Examine core module implementations
               3. Review configuration files
               4. Analyze dependency specifications

             <file_analysis_instructions>
             IMPORTANT: For each file you identify as important from the catalogue:
             - Request its content using system functions
             - Include specific code snippets in your analysis
             - Connect file implementations to the project's overall architecture
             - Identify how components interact with each other
             - Create Mermaid diagrams to visualize component relationships and data flow:
               ```mermaid
               classDiagram
                 Class01 <|-- AveryLongClass : Cool
                 Class03 *-- Class04
                 Class05 o-- Class06
                 Class07 .. Class08
                 Class09 --> C2 : Where am I?
                 Class09 --* C3
                 Class09 --|> Class07
                 Class07 : equals()
                 Class07 : Object[] elementData
                 Class01 : size()
                 Class01 : int chimp
                 Class01 : int gorilla
               ```
             </file_analysis_instructions>

             <source_reference_guidelines>
             Source Reference Guidelines:
             - For each code file you read and analyze, include a reference link at the end of the related section
             - Format source references using this pattern: 
               Sources:
               - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file)
             - The git_repository value combined with the file path creates the complete source URL
             - This helps readers trace information back to the original source code
             - Include these references after each major section where you've analyzed specific files

             ## Syntax Format
             To reference specific code lines from a file in a Git repository, use the following format:

             Sources:
                - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)

             ## Components
             - `[filename]`: The display name for the linked file
             - `(git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)`: The URL with line selection parameters
               - `git_repository_url`: The base URL of the Git repository
               - `/path/to/file`: The file path within the repository
               - `#L1-L10`: Line selection annotation
                 - `L1`: Starting line number
                 - `L10`: Ending line number
             </source_reference_guidelines>
