        </thought_process>

        9. Document Synthesis:
           Synthesize the gathered information into a well-structured document with clear hierarchical organization. Apply the documentation strategy developed in your thinking process. Create detailed Mermaid diagrams to illustrate code relationships, architecture, and data flow. Organize content logically with clear section headings, subheadings, and consistent formatting.

           Ensure the document thoroughly addresses the documentation objective with concrete examples and use cases. Include troubleshooting sections where appropriate to address common issues. Verify technical accuracy and completeness of all explanations and examples. Add code examples with syntax highlighting for key implementation patterns. Include performance analysis and optimization recommendations where relevant.

           If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them

        10. Documentation Style Matching:
            Ensure the generated document matches the style of the repository's documentation website. Enhance the analysis of referenced files, using Markdown syntax for clearer explanations. Utilize Markdown features such as tables, code blocks, and nested lists to improve readability and organization.

        When referencing code files or blocks, use the following format:

        For code files:
        Source:
         - [git_repository/path/file](filename)

        For code blocks:
        Source:
         - [git_repository/path/file#L280-L389](filename)

        Use the following Mermaid diagram types as appropriate:
        - Class diagrams
        - Sequence diagrams
        - Flowcharts
        - Entity Relationship diagrams
        - State diagrams

        Example Mermaid diagram (customize as needed):

        ```mermaid
        classDiagram
          class ClassName {
            +publicProperty: type
            -privateProperty: type
            #protectedProperty: type
            +publicMethod(param: type): returnType
            -privateMethod(param: type): returnType
            #protectedMethod(param: type): returnType
          }
          ClassName <|-- ChildClass: inherits
          ClassName *-- ComposedClass: contains
          ClassName o-- AggregatedClass: has
          ClassName --> DependencyClass: uses
        ```

        Remember to read and analyze all relevant files from the provided catalogue. All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information.

        Your final document should be structured as follows:

        1. Title
        2. Table of Contents
        3. Introduction
        4. Project Structure
        5. Core Components
        6. Architecture Overview
        7. Detailed Component Analysis
        8. Dependency Analysis
        9. Performance Considerations
        10. Troubleshooting Guide
        11. Conclusion
        12. Appendices (if necessary)

        Each section should include appropriate Mermaid diagrams, code snippets, and detailed explanations. Ensure that your documentation is comprehensive, well-structured, and clearly explains the codebase's architecture, functionality, and key components. Pay special attention to making code-related explanations very detailed and accessible to users with limited technical knowledge.

        Format your final output within <docs> tags using proper Markdown hierarchy and formatting. Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

        <docs>
        # [Document Title]

        ## Table of Contents
        1. [Introduction](#introduction)
        2. [Project Structure](#project-structure)
        3. [Core Components](#core-components)
        ...

        ## Introduction
        [Detailed introduction to the project, its purpose, and high-level overview]

        ## Project Structure
        [Comprehensive explanation of the project structure, including diagrams and file organization]

        ```mermaid
        [Project structure diagram]

            pass
        ```

        [Continue with remaining sections, ensuring each is thoroughly explained and illustrated]
        </docs>

        Remember to provide rich, detailed content for each section, addressing the documentation objective comprehensively. Assume that the reader may have limited technical knowledge, so explain complex concepts clearly and use analogies or real-world examples where appropriate.

       You are an AI assistant tasked with updating a document structure based on changes in a code repository. Your goal is to analyze the provided information and generate an updated document structure that reflects the current state of the project.
       
       First, carefully review the following information:
       
       1. Current repository directory structure:
       <repository_structure>
       {{catalogue}}
       </repository_structure>
       
       2. Current repository information:
       <repository_info>
       {{git_repository}}
       </repository_info>
       
       3. Recent Git update content:
       <git_update>
       {{git_commit}}
       </git_update>
       
       4. Existing document structure:
       <existing_document_structure>
       {{document_catalogue}}
       </existing_document_structure>
       
       5. README file (current repository's documentation introduction):
       <readme>
       {{readme}}
       </readme>
       
       Your task is to update the document structure based on the changes in the repository. Before providing the final output, conduct a thorough analysis using the following steps:
       
       1. Analyze the current repository structure, Git update content, existing document structure, and README file.
       2. Identify new content that needs to be added to the document structure.
       3. Identify existing content that needs to be updated.
       4. Identify content that should be removed from the document structure.
       
       Wrap your analysis inside <repository_change_analysis> tags. In this analysis:
       
       1. List all new files added to the repository.
       2. List all modified files in the repository.
       3. List all deleted files from the repository.
       4. For each change:
          a. Specify the file change (addition, modification, or deletion).
          b. Identify which parts of the document structure this change affects.
          c. Explain how it impacts the document structure (e.g., new section needed, section update required, section deletion required).
          d. Provide reasoning for the proposed change to the document structure.
          e. Categorize the impact of this change as minor, moderate, or major, and explain why.
          f. Consider the implications of this change on the overall document structure.
       5. Pay special attention to the git update content, thoroughly analyzing how the file changes affect the directory content and document structure.
       6. Summarize the overall impact on the document structure, noting major themes or areas of change.
       7. Consider how the README file content relates to the document structure and any necessary updates based on recent changes.
       8. Brainstorm potential new sections or subsections that might be needed based on the changes.
       
       After completing your analysis, generate an updated document structure in JSON format. Follow these guidelines:
       
       - Each section should have a title, name, type (add or update), dependent files, and a prompt for content creation.
       - The structure can be hierarchical, with sections having subsections (children).
       - For updated sections, include the ID of the section being updated.
       - Provide a list of IDs for sections that should be deleted.
       
       Your final output should be in the following JSON format:
       <document_structure>
       {
         "delete_id": [],
         "items": [
