        ## Source Reference Guidelines
        - Include reference links at the end of each section where you've analyzed specific files
        - Format source references using this pattern:
          ```
          Sources:
          - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file)
          ```
        - To reference specific code lines, use:
          ```
          Sources:
          - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)
          ```
        - Components:
          - `[filename]`: The display name for the linked file
          - `(git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)`: The URL with line selection parameters
            - `git_repository_url`: The base URL of the Git repository
            - `/path/to/file`: The file path within the repository
            - `#L1-L10`: Line selection annotation (L1: Starting line, L10: Ending line)
        - When referencing multiple related files, group them logically and explain their relationships
        - For critical code sections, include brief inline code snippets with proper attribution before the full source reference
        - Highlight key algorithms and data structures with dedicated code block examples
        </source_reference_guidelines>

# Comprehensive Project Analysis Framework

## 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Identify core components and map their relationships
- Document code organization principles and design patterns
- Generate visual representation of project architecture using Mermaid diagrams
- Analyze file distribution and module organization

## 2. Configuration Management
- Examine environment configuration files and variables
- Review build system and deployment configuration
- Document external service integration points and dependencies
- Identify configuration patterns and potential improvements

## 3. Dependency Analysis
- List external dependencies with version requirements
- Map internal module dependencies and coupling patterns
- Generate project dependency diagrams using Mermaid syntax:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A[Core Module] --> B[Dependency 1]
    A --> C[Dependency 2]
    B --> D[Sub-dependency]
    C --> E[Sub-dependency]
  ```
- Highlight critical dependencies and potential vulnerabilities

## 4. Project-Specific Analysis
- [FRAMEWORK]: Analyze framework-specific patterns and implementation
- [PROJECT_TYPE]: Evaluate specialized components for Web/Mobile/Backend/ML
- [CUSTOM]: Identify project-specific patterns and architectural decisions
- [PERFORMANCE]: Assess performance considerations unique to this project

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations
- Summarize project architecture and key characteristics
- Identify architectural strengths and potential improvement areas
- Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing code organization
- Outline next steps for project evolution and maintenance

PHASE 2: CATALOGUE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
Input source:
<catalogue>
{{$catalogue}}
</catalogue>

<section_adaptation>
Dynamically adjust analysis based on detected project characteristics:
- For **frontend projects**: Include UI component hierarchy, state management, and routing analysis with Mermaid component diagrams:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    App[App Component] --> Header[Header]
    App --> Router[Router]
    Router --> Page1[Page Component 1]
    Router --> Page2[Page Component 2]
    Page1 --> SharedComponent[Shared Component]
    Page2 --> SharedComponent
  ```

- For **backend services**: Analyze API structure, data flow, and service boundaries with Mermaid sequence diagrams:
  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    Client->>+API Gateway: Request
    API Gateway->>+Service A: Forward request
    Service A->>+Database: Query data
    Database-->>-Service A: Return data
    Service A-->>-API Gateway: Response
    API Gateway-->>-Client: Final response
  ```

- For **data-intensive applications**: Examine data models, transformations, and storage patterns with Mermaid entity-relationship diagrams:
  ```mermaid
  erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "ordered in"
  ```

- For **monorepos**: Map cross-project dependencies and shared utility usage with Mermaid flowcharts:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    SharedLib[Shared Libraries] --> ProjectA
    SharedLib --> ProjectB
    SharedLib --> ProjectC
    ProjectA --> CommonUtil[Common Utilities]
    ProjectB --> CommonUtil
  ```
</section_adaptation>

PHASE 3: DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS
For each key file identified in PHASE 2:
1. Read and analyze the content of main entry points
2. Examine core module implementations
3. Review configuration files
4. Analyze dependency specifications

IMPORTANT: For each file you identify as important from the catalogue:
- Request its content using system functions
- Include specific code snippets in your analysis
- Connect file implementations to the project's overall architecture
- Identify how components interact with each other
- Create Mermaid diagrams to visualize component relationships and data flow:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
    Class01 <|-- AveryLongClass : Cool
    Class03 *-- Class04
    Class05 o-- Class06
    Class07 .. Class08
    Class09 --> C2 : Where am I?
    Class09 --* C3
    Class09 --|> Class07
    Class07 : equals()
    Class07 : Object[] elementData
    Class01 : size()
    Class01 : int chimp
    Class01 : int gorilla
  ```

Source Reference Guidelines:
- For each code file you read and analyze, include a reference link at the end of the related section
- Format source references using this pattern: 
  Sources:
  - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file)
- The git_repository value combined with the file path creates the complete source URL
- This helps readers trace information back to the original source code
- Include these references after each major section where you've analyzed specific files

## Syntax Format
To reference specific code lines from a file in a Git repository, use the following format:

Sources:
   - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)

## Components
- `[filename]`: The display name for the linked file
- `(git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)`: The URL with line selection parameters
  - `git_repository_url`: The base URL of the Git repository
  - `/path/to/file`: The file path within the repository
  - `#L1-L10`: Line selection annotation
    - `L1`: Starting line number
    - `L10`: Ending line number

Verify the Mermaid syntax and return the corrected code

<instruction>
Check the following Mermaid syntax for errors. If any error is found, repair it. Only the correct Mermaid code is returned, without any explanation or additional text.
- Brackets cannot be directly used in the label of mermaid's flowchart node. It can be replaced by other symbols (such as brackets, dashes, newlines, etc.)
- For example, E[外部系统(RMS/BPM/PSA)]  should be changed to E[""外部系统(RMS/BPM/PSA)""]
- For example, E --|数据库/缓存|  should be changed to E -->|数据库/缓存| , and -- 实现 --> should be changed to --|实现|-->
- The subgraph should be in English, for example  subgraph 工厂与事件处理 should be changed to subgraph FactoryAndEventHandler  and The end must be followed by a blank line or a new line, and cannot be directly followed by other content
- RedisCache --> ""ICache"" in classDiagram should be RedisCache --> ICache
