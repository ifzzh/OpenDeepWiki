        ## Structured Thinking Process
        
        During document creation, you will use <think></think> tags to capture your reasoning and analytical process. This structured thinking must include:
        
        1. Project Structure Analysis <think>
           - What is the overall architecture of the project?
           - How are files organized (by feature, by layer, by technology)?
           - What are the main modules and their responsibilities?
           - What design patterns are evident in the project structure?
           - What are the key entry points to the application? </think>
        2. Data Structure Analysis <think>
           - What are the primary data structures used in the codebase?
           - How do these data structures relate to each other?
           - What are the time/space complexity implications of these choices?
           - Are there any custom data structures or optimizations?
           - What transformations do data undergo as they flow through the system?
           - How are data validated, sanitized, and secured? </think>
        3. Algorithm Analysis <think>
           - What are the key algorithms implemented in the codebase?
           - What is the computational complexity of these algorithms?
           - Are there performance bottlenecks or optimization opportunities?
           - How do the algorithms scale with input size?
           - Are there edge cases or special considerations in the implementation? </think>
        4. Dependency Analysis <think>
           - What are the internal and external dependencies?
           - How tightly coupled are the components?
           - Are there circular dependencies that could be problematic?
           - What interfaces define the boundaries between components?
           - How is dependency injection or inversion of control used? </think>
        5. Error Handling and Edge Cases <think>
           - How does the code handle errors and exceptions?
           - What validation exists for inputs and state transitions?
           - Are there failure recovery mechanisms?
           - How are boundary conditions and edge cases addressed? </think>
        6. Documentation Strategy <think>
           - Given the analysis, what is the most effective way to structure the documentation?
           - What visual representations will best communicate the system architecture?
           - What level of detail is appropriate for the target audience?
           - Which components require the most detailed explanation?
           - How can I best demonstrate the relationships between components? </think>
        
        The <think> sections are for your analytical process and will not appear in the final document. Use this structured thinking to inform the content of the final document. </structured_thinking_process>
        
        <document_creation_process>
        
        ## Document Creation Process

Document external dependencies and their integration points f. Map interface contracts and implementation details g. Identify reusable patterns and architectural motifs
        8. Use <think></think> tags to develop a comprehensive documentation strategy based on your analysis
           - Determine the most effective document structure
           - Select the most appropriate visualizations for different aspects of the codebase
           - Identify areas requiring detailed explanation vs. high-level overview
        9. Synthesize the gathered information into a well-structured document with clear hierarchical organization
           - Apply the documentation strategy developed in your thinking process
           - Create detailed diagrams to illustrate code relationships, architecture, and data flow using appropriate Mermaid diagram types
           - Organize content logically with clear section headings, subheadings, and consistent formatting
        10. Ensure the document thoroughly addresses the prompt objective with concrete examples and use cases
        11. Include troubleshooting sections where appropriate to address common issues
        12. Verify technical accuracy and completeness of all explanations and examples
        13. Add code examples with syntax highlighting for key implementation patterns
        14. Include performance analysis and optimization recommendations where relevant
        15. If analysis cannot be completed for certain files, document the limitations and reasons </document_creation_process>

        PHASE 2: CATALOGUE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
        Input source:
        <catalogue>
        {{$catalogue}}
        </catalogue>

        <section_adaptation>
        Dynamically adjust analysis based on detected project characteristics:
        - For **frontend projects**: Include UI component hierarchy, state management, and routing analysis with Mermaid component diagrams:
          ```mermaid
          graph TD
            App[App Component] --> Header[Header]
            App --> Router[Router]
            Router --> Page1[Page Component 1]
            Router --> Page2[Page Component 2]
            Page1 --> SharedComponent[Shared Component]
            Page2 --> SharedComponent
          ```

        - For **backend services**: Analyze API structure, data flow, and service boundaries with Mermaid sequence diagrams:
          ```mermaid
          sequenceDiagram
            Client->>+API Gateway: Request
            API Gateway->>+Service A: Forward request
            Service A->>+Database: Query data
            Database-->>-Service A: Return data
            Service A-->>-API Gateway: Response
            API Gateway-->>-Client: Final response
          ```

        - For **data-intensive applications**: Examine data models, transformations, and storage patterns with Mermaid entity-relationship diagrams:
          ```mermaid
          erDiagram
            USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
            ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
            PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "ordered in"
          ```

        - For **monorepos**: Map cross-project dependencies and shared utility usage with Mermaid flowcharts:
          ```mermaid
          graph TD
            SharedLib[Shared Libraries] --> ProjectA
            SharedLib --> ProjectB
            SharedLib --> ProjectC
            ProjectA --> CommonUtil[Common Utilities]
            ProjectB --> CommonUtil
          ```
        </section_adaptation>

        PHASE 3: DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS
        For each key file identified in PHASE 2:
        1. Read and analyze the content of main entry points
        2. Examine core module implementations
        3. Review configuration files
        4. Analyze dependency specifications

        IMPORTANT: For each file you identify as important from the catalogue:
        - Request its content using system functions
        - Include specific code snippets in your analysis
        - Connect file implementations to the project's overall architecture
        - Identify how components interact with each other
        - Create Mermaid diagrams to visualize component relationships and data flow:
          ```mermaid
          classDiagram
            Class01 <|-- AveryLongClass : Cool
            Class03 *-- Class04
            Class05 o-- Class06
            Class07 .. Class08
            Class09 --> C2 : Where am I?
            Class09 --* C3
            Class09 --|> Class07
            Class07 : equals()
            Class07 : Object[] elementData
            Class01 : size()
            Class01 : int chimp
            Class01 : int gorilla
          ```

        Source Reference Guidelines:
        - For each code file you read and analyze, include a reference link at the end of the related section
        - Format source references using this pattern: 
          Sources:
          - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file)
        - The git_repository value combined with the file path creates the complete source URL
        - This helps readers trace information back to the original source code
        - Include these references after each major section where you've analyzed specific files

        ## Syntax Format
        To reference specific code lines from a file in a Git repository, use the following format:

        Sources:
           - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)

        ## Components
        - `[filename]`: The display name for the linked file
        - `(git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)`: The URL with line selection parameters
          - `git_repository_url`: The base URL of the Git repository
          - `/path/to/file`: The file path within the repository
          - `#L1-L10`: Line selection annotation
            - `L1`: Starting line number
            - `L10`: Ending line number

Check the following Mermaid syntax for errors. If any error is found, repair it. Only the correct Mermaid code is returned, without any explanation or additional text.
- Brackets cannot be directly used in the label of mermaid's flowchart node. It can be replaced by other symbols (such as brackets, dashes, newlines, etc.)
- For example, E[外部系统(RMS/BPM/PSA)]  should be changed to E[""外部系统(RMS/BPM/PSA)""]
- For example, E --|数据库/缓存|  should be changed to E -->|数据库/缓存| , and -- 实现 --> should be changed to --|实现|-->
- The subgraph should be in English, for example  subgraph 工厂与事件处理 should be changed to subgraph FactoryAndEventHandler  and The end must be followed by a blank line or a new line, and cannot be directly followed by other content
- RedisCache --> ""ICache"" in classDiagram should be RedisCache --> ICache
