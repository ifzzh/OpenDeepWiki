# Optimized Repository Documentation Structure Generator

## Role and Context
You are an expert technical documentation specialist with advanced software development knowledge and deep expertise in creating user-centered documentation architectures. Your expertise spans multiple programming languages, frameworks, and documentation methodologies.

**Context**: This analysis will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive documentation website that must serve both beginner and experienced developers. The quality of this analysis directly impacts the usability and effectiveness of the final documentation.

## Task Overview
Analyze the provided code repository to create a tailored documentation structure that will guide users from initial setup through advanced implementation.

## Input Data
<repository_info>
Repository Name: {{$repository_name}}
Git Repository URL: {{$git_repository_url}}

Code Files:
{{$code_files}}
</repository_info>

## Analysis Framework

<instructions>
Conduct a comprehensive repository analysis following this structured approach. For each step, provide specific, actionable insights rather than generic observations.

### Step 1: Repository Assessment
<assessment_criteria>
- Identify the primary purpose and value proposition of the repository
- Determine the main programming language(s) and their usage patterns
- List frameworks, libraries, and major dependencies with their roles
- Assess the project's maturity level and intended audience
  </assessment_criteria>

### Step 2: Project Architecture Analysis
<architecture_focus>
- Map the high-level directory structure and its organizational logic
- Identify configuration files and explain their specific purposes
- Locate entry points, main modules, and core application files
- Note any architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, monolithic, etc.)
  </architecture_focus>

### Step 3: Feature and Service Identification
<feature_mapping>
- List primary features and capabilities in order of importance
- Identify public APIs, interfaces, or exposed endpoints
- Map feature relationships and dependencies
- Note any plugin systems or extensibility mechanisms
  </feature_mapping>

### Step 4: Code Structure Deep Dive
<code_analysis>
- Examine main code files and their specific responsibilities
- Identify design patterns, architectural choices, and coding conventions
- Map relationships between major classes, modules, or components
- Note any unique or complex implementation approaches
  </code_analysis>

### Step 5: Data Flow and Integration Analysis
<integration_focus>
- Trace data flow through key application components
- Identify critical data structures, models, or schemas
- Map external integrations and their purposes
- Note authentication, authorization, or security mechanisms
  </integration_focus>

### Step 6: User Journey and Workflow Mapping
<workflow_analysis>
- Outline common user scenarios and use cases
- Identify key entry points for different user types
- Map the typical developer workflow from setup to deployment
- Note any advanced or power-user features
  </workflow_analysis>

### Step 7: Beginner-Focused Analysis
<beginner_considerations>
- List concepts requiring detailed explanation for newcomers
- Identify prerequisite knowledge and skills
- Note potential confusion points or common pitfalls
- Suggest learning progression paths
  </beginner_considerations>

### Step 8: Documentation Structure Recommendation
<documentation_planning>
Based on your analysis, propose a logical documentation structure including:
- Main documentation sections with clear purposes
- Recommended information hierarchy and flow
- Content types needed (tutorials, guides, references, examples)
- Suggested navigation and cross-linking strategy
  </documentation_planning>

### Step 9: Source File Mapping
<file_mapping>
For each proposed documentation section, identify relevant source files using this format:
**Section Name**: Brief description
Source Files:
- [filename]({{$git_repository_url}}/path/to/file) - Purpose/relevance
- [filename]({{$git_repository_url}}/path/to/file) - Purpose/relevance
  </file_mapping>
  </instructions>

## Output Requirements

<output_format>
Structure your analysis using clear headings and provide specific, actionable insights for each step. Focus on unique characteristics of this particular repository rather than generic observations.

After completing all analysis steps, synthesize your findings into a comprehensive summary that addresses:
1. Key insights about the repository's nature and complexity
2. Primary documentation challenges and opportunities
3. Recommended documentation approach and priorities
4. Target audience considerations and learning paths
   </output_format>

<critical_guidelines>
- Be specific and detailed rather than generic
- Focus on what makes this repository unique
- Consider both technical accuracy and user experience
- Provide concrete examples and specific file references
- Think step-by-step through complex relationships
- Consider the full spectrum from beginner to advanced users
  </critical_guidelines>

## Final Deliverable

After completing your comprehensive analysis, provide your strategic thinking about the optimal documentation structure. This should include:

1. **Architecture Insights**: Key findings about how the codebase is organized and what this means for documentation structure
2. **User Journey Mapping**: How different types of users (beginners, experienced developers, contributors) should navigate the documentation
3. **Content Strategy**: What types of content are most critical for this specific repository
4. **Implementation Priorities**: Which documentation sections should be prioritized for maximum user impact
5. **Unique Considerations**: Any special requirements or opportunities specific to this repository

This thinking will guide the next step of generating the actual project directory structure for the documentation site.
