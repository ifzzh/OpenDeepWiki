- Document APIs, interfaces, endpoints, and public contracts
- Identify key user-facing components and their responsibilities
- Map feature relationships and dependencies
  </step_3>

<step_4>
**Code Content Analysis**
- Examine main code files and their specific responsibilities
- Identify recurring patterns, architectural choices, and design principles
- Note code organization strategies and modularization approaches
- Document coding standards and conventions observed
  </step_4>

<step_5>
**Feature Mapping**
- Create hierarchical feature and sub-feature lists

- Map main classes, modules, and their relationships
- Identify key abstractions and their concrete implementations
- Note separation of concerns and coupling patterns
  </step_7>

<step_8>
**Data Flow Analysis**
- Trace data flow through main application components
- Identify key data structures, models, schemas, and interfaces
- Document state management approaches and patterns
- Map data transformation and processing pipelines
  </step_8>

<step_9>
**Integration and Extension Points**
- Document plugin systems and extension mechanisms
- Explain integration patterns with external systems
- Identify customization and configuration options
- Note hooks, events, and callback systems
  </step_9>

<step_10>
**Dependency Mapping**
- List external dependencies and their specific purposes
- Document internal dependencies between components
- Note version requirements and compatibility constraints
- Identify critical vs. optional dependencies
  </step_10>

<step_11>
**User Workflow Mapping**
- Outline common user scenarios and workflows
- Identify key entry points for different use cases
- Document typical usage patterns and user journeys
- Map user goals to system capabilities
  </step_11>

<step_12>
**Documentation Structure Planning**
- Propose main documentation sections based on analysis
- Suggest logical information presentation order
- Identify documentation gaps requiring attention
- Consider multiple user paths through documentation
  </step_12>

<step_13>
**Dependent File Analysis**
- For each proposed documentation section, list relevant source files
- Use format: `- [filename]({{$git_repository_url}}/path/to/file)`
- Group files by documentation section relevance
- Note critical files requiring detailed explanation
  </step_13>
  </analysis_steps>
  </instructions>

## Output Format Requirements
<output_requirements>
<analysis_output>
<output-think>
Conduct thorough analysis following the 13-step framework. For each step, provide comprehensive insights that demonstrate deep understanding of the repository structure, functionality, and user needs. Consider:

1. **Technical Depth**: Analyze code patterns, architectural decisions, and implementation strategies
2. **User Experience**: Consider different user types (beginners, experienced developers, contributors)
3. **Documentation Strategy**: Think about information hierarchy, progressive disclosure, and multiple learning paths
4. **Project Context**: Consider the project's domain, complexity, and community needs
5. **Future Considerations**: Think about maintainability, extensibility, and evolution of documentation

Your thinking should guide the creation of a documentation structure that is:
- **Logically organized** with clear information hierarchy
- **User-centric** serving multiple audience types effectively
- **Comprehensive** covering all aspects of the project
- **Actionable** providing clear next steps for users
- **Maintainable** structured for easy updates and expansion

Focus especially on creating a documentation structure that facilitates understanding and adoption while minimizing cognitive load for new users.
