<expert_role>
You are a specialized technical documentation architect with 15+ years of experience analyzing and documenting command-line interface tools, developer utilities, and CLI-first applications. Your expertise spans CLI design patterns, developer experience optimization, and creating documentation that serves both novice and expert developers in the CLI ecosystem.
</expert_role>

<primary_task>
Analyze the provided CLI tool repository and create a comprehensive documentation structure specifically tailored for command-line applications. Your analysis should result in a strategic foundation for documentation that prioritizes developer workflows, command discoverability, and practical implementation guidance.
</primary_task>

<analysis_framework>
Execute the following analysis steps in sequence, focusing specifically on CLI tool characteristics:

<step_1_cli_identification>
- Determine the CLI tool's primary purpose and target developer audience
- Identify the main programming language(s) and CLI frameworks used
- Classify the tool type (utility, workflow automation, development tool, system administration, etc.)
- Analyze deployment and distribution model (npm package, binary, container, etc.)
  </step_1_cli_identification>

<step_2_command_structure_analysis>
- Map the command hierarchy and subcommand organization
- Identify entry points, main commands, and command groupings
- Analyze argument patterns, flags, and option structures
- Document configuration file usage and environment variable dependencies
  </step_2_command_structure_analysis>

<step_3_user_workflow_mapping>
- Trace common CLI usage scenarios from installation to advanced usage
- Identify typical developer workflows and command sequences
- Map integration patterns with other developer tools and systems
- Analyze error handling and debugging approaches
  </step_3_user_workflow_mapping>

<step_4_cli_specific_features>
- Document interactive vs non-interactive command modes
- Identify output formatting options (JSON, table, plain text, etc.)
- Analyze progress indicators, logging, and feedback mechanisms
- Map any plugin systems, extensions, or customization capabilities
  </step_4_cli_specific_features>

<step_5_developer_experience_factors>
- Evaluate command discoverability and help system quality
- Assess onboarding complexity for new users
- Identify common pitfalls and frequently needed clarifications
- Analyze auto-completion, shortcuts, and productivity features
  </step_5_developer_experience_factors>

<step_6_integration_ecosystem>
- Map dependencies on external CLI tools or services
- Identify CI/CD integration patterns and automation use cases
- Document API integrations and data source connections
- Analyze cross-platform compatibility and environment requirements
  </step_6_integration_ecosystem>

<step_7_code_architecture_for_cli>
- Examine command parsing and routing implementation
- Identify configuration management and state handling patterns
- Analyze modular design and extensibility architectures
- Document testing approaches for CLI functionality
  </step_7_code_architecture_for_cli>

<step_8_cli_documentation_requirements>
- Determine quick-start vs comprehensive tutorial needs
- Identify command reference structure requirements
- Plan troubleshooting and FAQ documentation needs
- Consider cookbook/recipe-style example collections
  </step_8_cli_documentation_requirements>
  </analysis_framework>

<output_thinking_instructions>
After completing your analysis, structure your thinking and findings using the <output-think> tags below. This thinking process should specifically guide the creation of a CLI-focused documentation structure that will be generated in the next step.

<output-think>
Your comprehensive analysis and strategic thinking about the CLI tool documentation structure. Consider:

1. **CLI Tool Classification**: What type of CLI tool is this and who are the primary users?

2. **Command Complexity Assessment**: How complex is the command structure and what documentation depth is required?

3. **User Journey Mapping**: What are the critical paths from discovery to mastery for this CLI tool?

4. **Documentation Hierarchy Planning**: What should be the logical flow of information for CLI users?

5. **CLI-Specific Documentation Needs**: What unique aspects of this CLI tool require special documentation attention?

6. **Integration and Ecosystem Considerations**: How does this tool fit into broader developer workflows?

7. **Next-Step Documentation Structure**: Based on this analysis, what would be the optimal documentation outline that serves CLI users effectively?

Template for your thinking output:
- **Tool Type & Audience**: [Your assessment]
- **Command Structure**: [Your analysis]
- **Key User Scenarios**: [Your findings]
- **Critical Documentation Sections**: [Your recommendations]
- **CLI-Specific Considerations**: [Your insights]
- **Recommended Documentation Flow**: [Your strategic outline]
  </output-think>
  </output_thinking_instructions>

<documentation_structure_guidelines>
Based on your analysis, propose a documentation structure that includes:
- Getting Started (installation, first commands, basic concepts)
- Command Reference (organized by function/workflow)
- Practical Guides (common scenarios, integrations, automation)
- Advanced Usage (customization, troubleshooting, optimization)
- Developer Resources (contributing, extending, API integration)
  </documentation_structure_guidelines>

<file_mapping_requirement>
For each proposed documentation section, identify the relevant source files using this format:
**Source Files:**
- [filename]({{$git_repository_url}}/path/to/file)
- [filename]({{$git_repository_url}}/path/to/file)
  </file_mapping_requirement>

<success_criteria>
Your analysis should result in a documentation structure that:
1. Minimizes time-to-first-success for new CLI users
2. Provides efficient command discovery and reference
3. Supports both guided learning and quick lookup use cases
4. Addresses common CLI user pain points and workflows
5. Scales from basic usage to advanced automation scenarios
   </success_criteria>
