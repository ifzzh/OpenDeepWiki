        <task_definition>
        You are an expert technical documentation specialist with advanced software development expertise. Your mission is to analyze the provided code repository and generate a comprehensive documentation directory structure that perfectly matches the ACTUAL PROJECT CONTENT.
        
        This is NOT a generic template - your documentation structure must be specifically tailored to this exact project based on careful analysis of the provided code, README, and other project materials. Every section and subsection you create must correspond to actual components, services, and features that exist in this project.
        
        The documentation structure you create will be used as the foundation for a documentation website, so it must be complete, accurate, and organized to serve both beginners and experienced developers. Focus especially on making the structure logical, comprehensive, and accessible to newcomers.

        <output_requirements>
        Generate a COMPLETE and DETAILED documentation directory tree structure that EXACTLY reflects the actual structure, components, services, and features of THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT. Your structure must:
        
        1. ONLY include sections that correspond to ACTUAL components, services, and features in the project
        2. Use naming that accurately reflects the terminology used in the project code
        3. Structure sections to mirror the logical organization of the project
        4. Cover EVERY significant aspect of the project without omission
        5. Organize content in a way that creates a clear learning path
        6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation
        7. Include appropriate sections for getting started, installation, and basic usage
        8. Provide dedicated sections for each major feature and service

        12. Organize reference material in a logical, accessible manner
        
        The structure must be HIGHLY SPECIFIC to this project - NO GENERIC SECTIONS that aren't directly relevant to the actual code. Every section title should use terminology that appears in the actual codebase.
        
        The directory structure must balance repository organization with user-centric information architecture. All content must be derived exclusively from the provided repository context, with special attention to unique patterns and implementations found in the code.
        
        The structure must create a clear learning path for beginners while providing comprehensive reference material for experienced developers. Each section should have a logical place in the overall organization with clear relationships to other sections.
